 scripts together assembled for the fundamental fullfillment of our motive. We currently have two versions of this project. The version 1 is based on smaller dataset collected 
 by us and we are planning to train that model for larger datasets. Thee version 2 is based on the vgg16 Convolutional Neural Network.
